# My Python Scripts


This repository is a collection of Python programs that I have written in my attempt to learn the Python programming language. It includes the following scripts : 
  1.  hello.py     - first Python program to display a greeting to the world.
  2.  guess.py     - interactive Guess the number game.
  3.  factorial.py - interactive factorial calculator.
  4.  primes.py    - displays first 100 prime numbers.
